# WAD Project: Online Shop
## About 
This project is a web-based application designed to simulate an online shop where every user has different attributes depending on their roles. For instance:
* a user can add products to cart, complete purchases and add reviews to products
* a collaborator can add and edit their own products to the online shop only with the admin's approval
* the admin can change users' roles, add reviews and make CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on all products

This application features a user-friendly interface and a responsive design for various devices. The backend handles product and user management and user authentication.
## What I learned
* the use and concept of entity framework core, identity framework, .NET, C#
* implementing authentication
* designing a relational database for the main elements of the application, such as products, categories, comments, users, purchases etc.
* integrating frontend and backend for a smooth user experience
* handling form validation
* implementing the attributes for the three roles: user, collaborator, admin
* implementing a search engine
* sorting products based on different criterias (by price ascending/descending, by rating ascending/descending)
* adding a reviewing system which consists of comments and rating stars from 1 to 5
* creating a shopping cart system where every user can add products, modify their quantities and complete purchases, every product's stock being automatically decreased after every purchase it was involved in
